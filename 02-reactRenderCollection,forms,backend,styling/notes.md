# a. Introduction to React

## JS arrays

- React devs use functional programming operators of the JavaScript array, such as find, filter, and map - all of the time.
- reduce is most important can transform array to objects or reduce them to nos., indexes, etc.

## Rendering Collections

- store data in main.js
- <ul>
        {notes.map((note) => (
          <li key={note.id}> {note.content}</li>
        ))}
  </ul>
- above map's each return statement is executed
- Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
- Keys tell React which array item each component corresponds to and how to update the view generated by a component when the component is re-rendered.

- Index as a key is an anti-pattern and is not recommended, eg =>
<ul> {notes.map((note,i) => <li key={i}>{note.content} </li>)} </ul>

## Misc

- Note that if you copy a project from one place to another, you might have to delete the node_modules directory and install the dependencies again with the command npm install before you can start the application.

- props being wrong data type is a common error. Print console.log(props)
